        "chat.py - this file is a simple chatbot that will chat with you about the contents of input.txt (you can copy/paste anything into this text file). Very useful to quickly discuss papers.\n",
        "generate_multiple_reports.py - this will consume all PDFs in the input/ folder and generate summaries in the output/ folder. This is helpful for bulk processing such as for literature reviews.\n",

        "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n",
        "This repository contains Python scripts that automate the process of generating reports from PDF files using OpenAI's GPT-4 model. The scripts extract text from PDF files, send the text to the GPT-4 model for processing, and save the generated reports as text files. The scripts also include functionality to render the generated reports as an HTML document for easy viewing.\n",

        "Obtain an API key from OpenAI and save it in a file named key_openai.txt in the root directory of the repository.\n",
        "Place the PDF files you want to generate reports from in the input/ directory.\n",
        "USAGE\n",
        "Run the generate_multiple_reports.py script to generate reports from the PDF files in the input/ directory. The generated reports will be saved as text files in the output/ directory.\n",
        "Run the render_report.py script to render the generated reports as an HTML document. The HTML document will be saved as report.html in the root directory of the repository.\n",
        "You can modify the prompts in generate_multiple_reports.py to focus on any questions you would like to ask. In other words you can automatically ask any set of questions in bulk against any set of papers. This can help you greatly accelerate your literature reviews and surveys.\n",
        "NOTE\n",
        "The scripts are designed to handle errors and retries when communicating with the OpenAI API. If the API returns an error due to the maximum context length being exceeded, the scripts will automatically trim the oldest message and retry the API call. If the API returns any other type of error, the scripts will retry the API call after a delay, with the delay increasing exponentially for each consecutive error. If the API returns errors for seven consecutive attempts, the scripts will stop and exit.'''"
